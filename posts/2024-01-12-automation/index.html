<h1>The High Costs of Automation<a class="headerlink" href="#the-high-costs-of-automation" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>We have seen huge advances both in tooling and in best practices, both for
Python in particular, and programming in general. We use version control
systems, we write tests, we have code formatting, coverage, linting, automated
type checking, dependency management and packaging tools. We use continuous
integration and even continuous release. We have issue reporting, code review,
sprint and release planning, and documentation. And we can use all of that
automatically, on every commit, making sure of high quality of our work at all
times.</p>
<p>But should we?</p>
<p>Of course each of those tools comes with numerous advantages. After all, if
they weren’t useful, why would we be using them? But running them all the time
in an automated way has a hidden cost that you might want to consider.</p>
<section id="code-formatting">
<h2>Code Formatting<a class="headerlink" href="#code-formatting" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Let’s start with code formatting tools, such as Black or Blue, or even just the
code formatting checking tools, such as pep8 or flake. Their role is simple:
they are there to make sure all the code in your project follows the same,
consistent style. A friend of mine told me that ever since they run one of
those tools automatically on all commits, there is no more arguing about code
formatting in code reviews, and they can use that time for having other kinds
of pointless arguments instead.</p>
<p>Obviously, if you have consistent code formatting in your project, that is a
good thing, right? It’s a sign of a healthy project and high quality of code,
isn’t it? Well, not necessarily.</p>
