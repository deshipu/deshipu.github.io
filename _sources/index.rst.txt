Welcome
*******

It's not much, but it's mine. This is where I keep assorted bits of information
that I would like to share with the world. It used to be a wiki, editable by
anyone, but only spam bots edited it, so now I've closed it down to make the
RSS feed more useful â€“ now you can actually use it to see the updates of the
website. If you have any comments, suggestions, questions or messages, you can
drop me an e-mail.
