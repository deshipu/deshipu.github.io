New Website
***********

My hosting provider is dropping their service, and that has forced me to look
for another solution for hosting my website. I've been toying with the idea of
a statically-generated blog for a long time, and this finally pushed me to try
it.

I'm using `ablog <https://ablog.readthedocs.io>`_, which lets me write articles
using the familiar `sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_ markup, and publish
them on Github Pages.

Of course I had to customize it a bit to generate less bloated HTML and to use
my own custom CSS --- not everything could be changed to be the way that I
like, but I'm mostly happy with it.

Now I "just" need to migrate all the content that I want to keep from the old
wiki and WikiCreole markup to this and ReStructuredText.
