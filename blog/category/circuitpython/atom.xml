    <title>CircuitPython in 2020</title>
    <updated>2020-01-02T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="circuitpython-in-2020"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like I’m mostly using this blog to answer &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/01/01/what-do-you-want-from-circuitpython-in-2020-circuitpython2020-circuitpython/"&gt;Adafruit’s prompts for
feedback on CircuitPython&lt;/a&gt;. Oh well, so be it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="the-projects"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Projects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section id="pewpew"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;PewPew&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;aside class="system-message"&gt;
&lt;p class="system-message-title"&gt;System Message: INFO/1 (&lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;/home/sheep/dev/ablog/dopieralski.pl/posts/2020-01-02-circuitpython.rst&lt;/span&gt;, line 6); &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="#id1"&gt;backlink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duplicate implicit target name: “pewpew”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pewpew.rtfd.io"&gt;PewPew&lt;/a&gt; educational game console project is still
alive, and there has been some progress. EuroPython gave out 1400 devices to
Python developers at a conference, and I helped design and manufacture some
custom units for some more conferences. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://makerfabs.com"&gt;MakerFabs&lt;/a&gt; —
the fabrication company that is helping me with this is now selling PewPew
Standalone consoles for $10 a piece for everyone who have any kind of workshop,
entertainment or hacking needs. There is even a mailing list at
&lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;pewpew&amp;#64;python.org&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and I’m trying to keep everyone updated by sending
monthly summaries to it (I only skipped one month so far).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the device is not perfect, and I have decided to pursue the successor
to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ugame.rtfd.io"&gt;µGame&lt;/a&gt; to try an fix that. It’s a blend of PewPew
and µGame, being able to run programs for both (and also MakerCode Arcade and
PyGamer/PyBadge device too). It’s going to be considerably cheaper than
Adafruit’s offerings, but it’s also not supposed to be competing with them.
I needed the display to show the error messages, because those turned out to
be the hardest part of working with PewPews — not everyone can get the REPL
going easily. In any case, I worked on the successor, PewPew M4 for a good part
of the last year, and it’s ready now. I’m going to be sending out the first
units to reviewers and people interested in development for it soon, and then
we will try to make the devices available through MakerFabs just like the
PewPew Standalone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="robots"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Robots&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still have the low-cost spider-like walking robots on my drawing boards, and
they are going to run CircuitPython too. The plan to re-start the development
with a more integrated Kubik M0 unfortunately failed: after fixing some bugs
with PWM channels, it turned out that the SAMD21 that I was using simply
doesn’t have enough PWM outputs to drive all the 12 servos of this robot. That
means I probably need a bigger chip, and it would probably make more sense to
use the BLE-capable NRF52840 and not the SAMD51. But that also means it will be
Kubik M4 and not M0, and I still need to do my research about the NRF52840. I
have the NRF52840 Feather at hand, but it’s the non-express version, which is
apparently no longer supported. So either I bring back the support for it, hack
an SPI flash chip on it, or switch to an express board. We will see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mean time, I also resurrected the SpiderWing, which can work with pretty
much any Feather board. The recent modifications added battery protection to
it, which is an important feature. I will use it for a platform for
experimenting with BLE robots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="keyboards"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Keyboards&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After visiting a local annual meetup of mechanical keyboard enthusiasts, I got
an urge to make a very flat keyboard (just a PCB and low-profile choc
switches), and since I didn’t have much room on it, I decided to put a SAMD21
on it. Once I had that, it was very easy to write a simple firmware for it,
especially since the USB support really improved recently. There was no support
for CapsLock, but it was surprisingly easy to hack it on with the help of
Adafruit staff, and there is now a pull request in works for adding it
properly. The ability to disable the drive, midi, mouse and all those other
funky USB endpoints also helped a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="circuitpython-development"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CircuitPython Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up not contributing as much as I wanted to CircuitPython development
this last year, but I am still amazed with the progress it made. The display
support is now very good, and there is no need for my TextMode library anymore.
You can do pretty much anything with the displayio that you could do with the
stage library, and much more on top of that. The stage is still a little bit
faster and uses a bit less memory (because of the limitations it has), so I
keep using and maintaining it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still didn’t have any time to play with the wireless capabilities: the Nina
firmware, the awesome BLE work, the LoRa and other radio modules. Maybe this
year I will have more luck with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did add (non-animated) GIF support to the loadimage library (and also to
stage), and it could easily be extended to support animation as well. I also
did some small improvement with buffer allocation for the audio module, and
that CapsLock support thing most recently — but I would really love to do more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t get to implement any of my last-year crazy project ideas. They are up
for grabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="micropython-development"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MicroPython Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I no longer pay much attention to that project, I did notice some
progress in there. Most importantly for me, there is now some support for
dynamically loadable C modules, so I tried to port the Stage library to that.
Unfortunately it doesn’t seem to be mature/featurefull/finished enough for it
to work, and the help is as usual non-existent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="future-plans"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Future Plans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t really have any are in CircuitPython right now that I would
particularly want to work on and improve. I really want to give more focus
to the PewPew, the Stage library, and the examples and tutorials for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would also love to see the PewPew M4 become popular/useful, and people
writing games for it. I think there is a need for some place where people
can find CircuitPython-based games for the µGame, PyBadge, PyGamer, PyPortal,
and PewPew M4, download and play them, see the code, read the tutorials about
making them, and so on. I also think it would be nice if game creators could
sell their games — I’m thinking about a platform like itch.io for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to get back to the robots for a little bit, and I have some nice ideas
for them, though nothing overly specific yet. We will see how it goes with the
wireless communication research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m waiting with bated breath for the ESP32-S2 board, but it will be probably
another year or two before CircuitPython works on that (if ever).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="summary"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been an amazing year for CircuitPython, and a huge amount of work has
been done. I wish I could have been more involved, but day job interferes. I’m
going to bring back some of my old projects this year and see if I can make
them work even better with CircuitPython now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>CircuitPython in 2021</title>
    <updated>2021-01-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="circuitpython-in-2021"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is once again time for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/01/01/where-should-circuitpython-go-in-2021-circuitpython2021-circuitpython/"&gt;Adafruit’s prompt for
feedback on CircuitPython&lt;/a&gt;. Let’s see what I did
last year and what I hope for this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="the-projects"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Projects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year was slow project-wise. I did some work on a new, cheaper version of
my walking robots, but they still need a lot of programming work. Then I went
into the rabbit hole of low-profile mechanical keyboards, built half a dozen of
them, until I made a perfect one for me. In the process I also made a library
for keyboards that has substantially lower resource requirements than existing
ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also ported the Stage game library to a few new platforms, re-made the menu
program for it, and merged a couple of improvements from other contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now I’m working on a 6-hole MIDI ocarina, and I’m considering doing a
business-card sized flat version of PewPew Standalone, with bi-color LEDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="the-future"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After most of my plans went awry in 2020, I’m careful about planning anything
this year. I think I will just be making small projects to keep myself sane,
and see how the situation develops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of development of CircuitPython, I’m really looking forward to the
dynamic USB descriptors, because that will let me make my keyboards more usable
for the general public, and then it will make sense to actually publish them
properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also nice to see the work around deep sleep, as this might let me save on
some parts in the future, moving the power switch to software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work around reset, safe mode and what file should be run after reset will
allow me optimize the menu program for PewPews a little better, giving more
memory to the games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what I can see most work is still focused on ESP32-S2, but I don’t find
this particularly interesting for myself. I’m not a great fan of wireless
solutions in general, and WiFi in particular seems a bit heavy for
microcontroller-based projects. The need for certification also limits greatly
what kind of projects I could make with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s great to see the CircuitPython project progressing and getting more
popular, and I am very grateful to all contributors for it. Having said that,
I think it is slowly reaching a point where it has most of what is needed, so
it’s difficult to be excited about new developments — they are no longer such
big steps forward. Of course in the long run it is a good thing — we can focus
more on things we are building with the tool, not on the tool itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>CircuitPython in 2022</title>
    <updated>2022-01-22T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="circuitpython-in-2022"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As every year, it’s time for a yearly summary and plans of all things I do
that are related to CircuitPython.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="the-projects"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Projects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I made a record number of keyboards, and also greatly improved my
keyboard library, uKeeb. Some features were added, because CircuitPython now
supports them: CapsLock LED, disabled disk and console, NKRO and BOOT modes,
keypad module. Others I added as new keyboards needed them: proper hold/tap
with rollover timeout, layer switching improvements, mouse support, LED
animations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My FluffBug robot is now at hardware version 5, but software-wise there was
no progress. I got the per-leg inverse kinematics done, and I should write
the walking code, but I can’t find the motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MIDI Ocarina is now at version 3. I gave up on the barometric pressure
sensor for detecting blowing, as its recovery time was poor, and instead
switched to a PDM microphone using audiobusio. This works great. I still need
to write the MIDI code for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried the new camera code, but I couldn’t get it to work with the camera
breakouts that I have. Either I’m using wrong pins, or something broke in the
IDF version I used. I have no energy to investigate this further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also gave up on making the uGame console work with newer versions of
CircuitPython – the changes in interrupt handling and time module related to
adding sleep made the SAMD21 port work so erratically, that I simply gave up.
I did fix the PewPew code by avoiding using the time module altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a but in the PWM code on SAMD that makes it hang completely
in a loop waiting for a register flag that never gets set. I got that far
debugging it, but why it never gets set is a mystery to me, and nobody
seems to be interested in fixing it. I worked around it in Stage library
by simply setting the backlight pin high, not using PWM at all, but I got
bitten by the same bug recently in the ocarina code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="the-future"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I want to finish FluffBug at least to the point where it walks and
uses the leg sensors and the distance sensors. I wish I could get the camera
to work with it as well. I might also try a gesture sensor, and an
accelerometer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I received a nice ESP32-S2 development board with a display from MakerFabs,
and I want to get the display working with displayio. Unfortunately it’s a
16-bit parallel, with non-consecutive data pins, so I would need to work
on the relevant module first. No idea how much work it would require.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a cool watch project using a SAML22 microcontroller, which should
be very similar to SAMD21. The author mentioned that he wants to get a port
of CircuitPython working on it. I’m very interested in this, because that
chip also has an LCD-driving circuitry, which would allow me to make even
cheaper version of the PewPew console, with a custom LCD screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might be making another handheld game console, with a 3.2”
screen and ESP32-S2 as the brains, but I’m not entirely sure yet. I’m doing
research on how viable it would be, and collecting parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year brought some cool developments around USB and keyboards, but also
a lot of frustration with keeping my existing projects working despite new
bugs. The SAMD family seems to now get very little attention, and it suffered
greatly with the addition of sleep support. Not being able to find and fix
those bugs is very frustrating, and drains energy I could use on projects
instead. The new boards are ridiculously powerful, but considerably more
complex to use in projects, unless using a ready development board. I think
I will focus on the Lolin S2 Mini boards for my projects this year, however,
while I mentioned some things I hope to work on, I am aware that I have
very little energy left for this. Hopefully my health and the overall global
situation will improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>My Tech Wishes for 2025</title>
    <updated>2025-07-08T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="my-tech-wishes-for-2025"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it’s a bit late in the year for this kind of post, but I have been busy
with other things. In any case, I decided to make it about general technology
related wishes, and not just CircuitPython, but large part of this is going to
be about CircuitPython anyways. Or at least related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="media-transfer-protocol"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Media Transfer Protocol&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exposing your microcontroller to the computer it is connected to as a disk
drive is getting really popular now. And it makes a lot of sense too — it doesn’t require you to install any drivers or programs, it easy to understand, and
very convenient. CircuitPython does it too and I love it. But it does introduce
a number of problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have to use a filesystem that is supported on most operating system, and
with the small sizes you have, it’s usually FAT12, which is not great for
flash wearing off or fragmentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since diskettes are not as common anymore, proprietary operating systems
don’t have their implementations of FAT12 tested as well as other things,
which means there are lots of bugs in MacOS and Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tools like virus scanners or disk monitors see those drives as regular disks
and often interact with them in ways that breaks them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can write to the disk only from one side, either through USB, or from
your code on the device, but not both at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of those problems could be trivially solved if we could only use the MTP
protocol instead of exposing the disk as a physical device with USB MSC. MTP
uses commands to manipulate the files, kinda like FTP, instead of writing to
the disk directly, and writes themselves are done by the microcontroller
itself, so it’s easy to use any custom filesystem you want, and to ensure
proper interactions when multiple operations are happening from different
sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is only one problem, and that is iTunes. You see, back when Apple’s flag
product was a music player, they were very jealous about it, and they tried
very hard to “protect” their users from using any other music player. They made
sure their player uses a custom, proprietary protocol for transferring the
music collection, and they also made sure that Apple computers didn’t support
transferring of arbitrary files using MTP. They had a problem in that most
cameras were already using MTP to transfer photos, and their users needed that,
so they made it an exception: you can use MTP on a Mac, but only for
transferring image files, and not any other file. Neat, eh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today you can only find iPads in museums, and iTunes is just a memory in some
boomer nightmares, but the decision they made back then stays. No arbitrary
files with MTP, if you use a Mac, you have to install a special program to use
MTP for anything else than photos. So any microcontroller device that uses MTP
would not work out of the box on Apple products, which means that nobody does
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my wish is for someone at Apple to revise that decision, recognize how
stupid and harmful it was, and remove that stupid limitation from all of their
operating systems, thank you very much. I would also like to see some ready to
use libraries and examples for using MTP, but that will surely come once it’s
usable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="circuitpython-on-ch32v208"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CircuitPython on CH32V208&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something I would love to do myself, but I’m scared to even start, as
it is a huge amount of work, and just outside of my comfort zone. Basically,
the bluetooth versions of the CH32 chips tend to have a lot of memory for the
bluetooth stack, and that makes it theoretically possible to run CircuitPython
or LUA on them (as long as we don’t need the bluetooth). It’s a nice cheap
chip, and it would be perfect as a replacement for the SAMD21 chips I currently
use for the PewPew devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course porting whole CircuitPython to a new chip is a lot of work, and it’s
something I have never done before, so naturally it’s scary. But people do it,
so it’s definitely possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="voice-synthesis"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Voice Synthesis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my failed attempts to port the SAM voice synthesiser from MicroBit to
CircuitPython, I’m happy to see that someone ported it to MicroPython, but
not as a C library, as I wanted to do, but literally rewrote it in Python.
Now I need to take it and see if it works in CircuitPython as well. Then I can
make my robots speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="servo-controller-on-ch32v003"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Servo Controller on CH32V003&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one I’m actually perfectly capable of finishing on my own, I just need to
find the energy to work on it. I basically want to control 16 servos with good
resolution using PWM signals specified through I2C. I already have the PWM part
working, and there are plenty of examples for I2C slave. It’s just a question
of sitting down and actually writing the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I have it, I can use it in the future versions of FluffBug and WeeBug, and
also a robot for the new small OpenMV board. It would free up 8 pins on the
Xiao, which could then be used for a display or I2S amplifier. It would also
allow for connecting additional servos, for things like arms or moving
features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="led-matrices-on-ch32v003"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;LED Matrices on CH32V003&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have two projects with LED matrices for the CH32V003 that I still need
to program. One is a spectrum analyzer thing, and the hard part is the FFT
code for it (though there are plenty of examples), and the other is a business
card fake PewPew—not really running CircuitPython, but with some of the
PewPew games implemented directly in C and hardcoded in the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="gif-pendant"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;GIF Pendant&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I’m also still working on my GIF pendant project. Now with a round
screen and CH32V208 as the brains. I have a TinyUSB example for USB MSC in
RAM working on it. What I need to figure out how to put the storage on the
internal flash instead, and how to access it from the code to render those
GIF files onto the screen. Again, it’s something I have never done, and there
isn’t much documentation about it around, so it’s a lot of trial and error.
I wish someone who is more knowledgable about TinyUSB and USB MSC could help
me with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s pretty much it for me for 2025. It’s mostly projects I would like
to finish (or would like someone to finish for me), except for that Apple MTP
thing. Will I get any of my wishes come true? We will see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>CircuitPython in 2026</title>
    <updated>2026-01-11T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="circuitpython-in-2026"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s that time when the CircuitPython project is looking for feedback from the
users, so here is some of mine again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been mostly focused on three projects using CircuitPython last year: my
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://deshipu.art/projects/project-188909/"&gt;quadruped robots&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://deshipu.art/projects/project-185291/"&gt;PewPew
game console&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://deshipu.art/projects/project-178061/"&gt;µGame
game console&lt;/a&gt;.  I didn’t have
much energy to do any serious progress on any one of them, but I did some
experimenting, and I have some ideas for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I failed in my attempts to port the speech synthesis engine from MicroBit to
CircuitPython as a C module, but &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jacklinquan/micropython-samtts"&gt;someone ported the project&lt;/a&gt; it is based on (the SAM,
Software Automatic Mouth) to plain Python code, and it runs on CircuitPython,
albeit the format conversions necessary to subsequently play it using
&lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;audioio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; make it somewhat slow. Unfortunately, the non-repeat playback of
&lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;RawSample&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is currently pretty broken in CircuitPython, so even though I did
get this to work, it’s not really usable until those bugs introduced later
changes are fixed. I took a stab at one of them, but I’m not really familiar
with that code enough to know what it was supposed to be doing in the first
place. In any case, there is a way to do voice synthesis in CircuitPython now,
which is nice for things like talking robots. We can hope the audio libraries
will become more stable in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have given up on working on a touch version of the &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;keypad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; module for the
SAMD21 port. The main problem is that those registers are completely
undocumented, because Microchip sells a commercial library that uses them, and
prefers for everyone to use that. Adafruit worked around that with their
current CircuitPython code, but without access to the same documentation, I
have little chance. Having that module would greatly improve the functioning
of those PewPew devices that use touchpads for the buttons – right now the
code is polling them, which is slow and unresponsive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also looked at using different chip than the hard to obtain SAMD21 for
the PewPew devices, in particular the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.wch-ic.com/products/CH32V208.html"&gt;CH32V208&lt;/a&gt; looks very promising. It has
64kB of RAM, 128kB of Flash, and clock up to 144MHz, which should be sufficient
for CircuitPython running simple games of the PewPew. The problem is, of
course, that there is currently no port of CircuitPython to that chip. I looked
a bit into what would be involved into making such a port, and I will probably
give it a go at some point, but the task is somewhat daunting and certainly
requires more energy than I have at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I’m finalizing the hardware for the ESP32-S3 version of the µGame
handheld game console. You can think about it as &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4200"&gt;Adafruit PyBadge&lt;/a&gt;, but with larger screen, and more RAM
and Flash. And somewhat better looking, in my opinion.  There are no changes in
CircuitPython necessary for it, except for the board definition, which I will
submit once I’m sure about the hardware, and once I get a USB pid for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the near future, I want to focus more on writing new games for
CircuitPython, in particular, I really want to make a roguelike game for that
platform, as I don’t think there is one yet. It feels to me like I should do
the hardware work first, the put off the fun of making the games, but the
reality is that a game console without games is a pretty boring thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the CircuitPython project itself, I think it’s in a good place in terms
of functionality. Yes, better async support and fewer bugs would be nice, but
there really isn’t anything that stops me from doing the things I want to do
with it.&lt;/p&gt;
