<p>A lot of disagreements in software engineering seem to have a deeper background
than mere technical considerations. Should you move fast and break things, or
should you reinvent the wheel? Does it matter how the code looks like when it
does what you want? And what is the purpose of it all in the first place?  I
propose that many of those arguments arise from different people using
different of two possible fixed worldviews in a variety of contexts, which they
assign automatically and mostly unconsciously, in a similar way to how our
brain resolves bistable perceptions. Furthermore, I propose that the ability to
consciously switch between the two worldviews, and the experience needed to
decide which one to use in the given context, are crucial for the work of a
software engineer.</p>

<p>Before we were somewhat brutally brought into the loving embrace of the Roman
Catholic Church by our considerate neighbours, my country had its own “pagan”
religion, with its own mythology and traditions. A lot of the traditions
survive in some way, because you can’t tell people they no longer have
a holiday on a given day just because they are worshipping a different god
now, but most information about the beliefs of my ancestors have been
judiciously eradicated by the same people who were at the time responsible for
preserving history – the chroniclers were mostly priests at the time, after
all. Some of it has been reconstructed from mentions in various historical
texts, but there is very little that is certain. Which is a great shame,
because those “primitive” mythologies often were records of knowledge about
the world and its workings, presented in a form that is easy for people to
understand – attitudes and relationships. That’s why gods in them are mostly
humans with special powers connected with the nature. And that “pagan”
mythology could tell us a lot about how the society functioned back then.</p>
