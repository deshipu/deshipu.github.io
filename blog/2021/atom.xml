&lt;p&gt;It is once again time for &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/01/01/where-should-circuitpython-go-in-2021-circuitpython2021-circuitpython/&quot;&gt;Adafruit’s prompt for
feedback on CircuitPython&lt;/a&gt;. Let’s see what I did
last year and what I hope for this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;the-projects&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Projects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year was slow project-wise. I did some work on a new, cheaper version of
my walking robots, but they still need a lot of programming work. Then I went
into the rabbit hole of low-profile mechanical keyboards, built half a dozen of
them, until I made a perfect one for me. In the process I also made a library
for keyboards that has substantially lower resource requirements than existing
ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also ported the Stage game library to a few new platforms, re-made the menu
program for it, and merged a couple of improvements from other contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now I’m working on a 6-hole MIDI ocarina, and I’m considering doing a
business-card sized flat version of PewPew Standalone, with bi-color LEDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;the-future&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After most of my plans went awry in 2020, I’m careful about planning anything
this year. I think I will just be making small projects to keep myself sane,
and see how the situation develops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of development of CircuitPython, I’m really looking forward to the
dynamic USB descriptors, because that will let me make my keyboards more usable
for the general public, and then it will make sense to actually publish them
properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also nice to see the work around deep sleep, as this might let me save on
some parts in the future, moving the power switch to software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work around reset, safe mode and what file should be run after reset will
allow me optimize the menu program for PewPews a little better, giving more
memory to the games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what I can see most work is still focused on ESP32-S2, but I don’t find
this particularly interesting for myself. I’m not a great fan of wireless
solutions in general, and WiFi in particular seems a bit heavy for
microcontroller-based projects. The need for certification also limits greatly
what kind of projects I could make with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s great to see the CircuitPython project progressing and getting more
popular, and I am very grateful to all contributors for it. Having said that,
I think it is slowly reaching a point where it has most of what is needed, so
it’s difficult to be excited about new developments — they are no longer such
big steps forward. Of course in the long run it is a good thing — we can focus
more on things we are building with the tool, not on the tool itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
