&lt;p&gt;As every year, it’s time for a yearly summary and plans of all things I do
that are related to CircuitPython.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;the-projects&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Projects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I made a record number of keyboards, and also greatly improved my
keyboard library, uKeeb. Some features were added, because CircuitPython now
supports them: CapsLock LED, disabled disk and console, NKRO and BOOT modes,
keypad module. Others I added as new keyboards needed them: proper hold/tap
with rollover timeout, layer switching improvements, mouse support, LED
animations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My FluffBug robot is now at hardware version 5, but software-wise there was
no progress. I got the per-leg inverse kinematics done, and I should write
the walking code, but I can’t find the motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MIDI Ocarina is now at version 3. I gave up on the barometric pressure
sensor for detecting blowing, as its recovery time was poor, and instead
switched to a PDM microphone using audiobusio. This works great. I still need
to write the MIDI code for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried the new camera code, but I couldn’t get it to work with the camera
breakouts that I have. Either I’m using wrong pins, or something broke in the
IDF version I used. I have no energy to investigate this further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also gave up on making the uGame console work with newer versions of
CircuitPython – the changes in interrupt handling and time module related to
adding sleep made the SAMD21 port work so erratically, that I simply gave up.
I did fix the PewPew code by avoiding using the time module altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a but in the PWM code on SAMD that makes it hang completely
in a loop waiting for a register flag that never gets set. I got that far
debugging it, but why it never gets set is a mystery to me, and nobody
seems to be interested in fixing it. I worked around it in Stage library
by simply setting the backlight pin high, not using PWM at all, but I got
bitten by the same bug recently in the ocarina code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;the-future&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I want to finish FluffBug at least to the point where it walks and
uses the leg sensors and the distance sensors. I wish I could get the camera
to work with it as well. I might also try a gesture sensor, and an
accelerometer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I received a nice ESP32-S2 development board with a display from MakerFabs,
and I want to get the display working with displayio. Unfortunately it’s a
16-bit parallel, with non-consecutive data pins, so I would need to work
on the relevant module first. No idea how much work it would require.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a cool watch project using a SAML22 microcontroller, which should
be very similar to SAMD21. The author mentioned that he wants to get a port
of CircuitPython working on it. I’m very interested in this, because that
chip also has an LCD-driving circuitry, which would allow me to make even
cheaper version of the PewPew console, with a custom LCD screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might be making another handheld game console, with a 3.2”
screen and ESP32-S2 as the brains, but I’m not entirely sure yet. I’m doing
research on how viable it would be, and collecting parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year brought some cool developments around USB and keyboards, but also
a lot of frustration with keeping my existing projects working despite new
bugs. The SAMD family seems to now get very little attention, and it suffered
greatly with the addition of sleep support. Not being able to find and fix
those bugs is very frustrating, and drains energy I could use on projects
instead. The new boards are ridiculously powerful, but considerably more
complex to use in projects, unless using a ready development board. I think
I will focus on the Lolin S2 Mini boards for my projects this year, however,
while I mentioned some things I hope to work on, I am aware that I have
very little energy left for this. Hopefully my health and the overall global
situation will improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
